Calculate the weight associated to a given shiftercon.

`shiftercon` points from the origin of the ultracell to some point P.
All bisector planes that can be generated from the `super_points` are
checked against a condition for P. That is whether point P is located
in the half space that contains the origin (inside), in the other
half space (outside) or if it is an element of the dividing plane.

  - `weight=0` if point P is considered outside ANY bisector plane
  - `weight=1` if point P is considered inside ALL bisector planes
  - `weight=1/(degen+1)` if P is considered as an element of `degen` planes

In the third case `1/weight` corresponds to the number of
translationally equivalent points to P. The restrictions ANY and ALL in
cases one and two cause to restrict the whole treatment to a Wigner-Seitz
cell around the origin built with the `super_points`.

    fold_to_qe_origin(
        unit_point_frac::Vector{Int64},
        unit_multiplicity_super::Vector{Int64})

Fold a unitcell point in fractional coordinates back into a unitcell point that
is inside the supercell at the origin whilst converting to a 1-based (QE-like)
coordinate system inside this supercell.

Example:If the unitcell-multiplicity in one direction was 6, then this function will
map the unit point in that direction NOT onto the integer interval `[0,5]` but`[1,6]`

# Arguments

  - `unit_point_frac::Vector{Int64}`: Output from `build_unitcell_points_frac()`
  - `unit_multiplicity_super::Vector{Int64}`: Multiplicities of unitcells inside
    of a supercell in each of the lattice vector directions. The `j`-th element
    corresponds to the multiplicity in the lattice vector direction given by
    `unit_lattvecs[j,:]`.

# Output

  - `folds::Vector{Int64}`: `unit_point_frac` was the origin of a unitcell in the
    ultracell in fractional coordinates.This got folded back into the supercell
    at the origin. `folds` is the result from the folding process whose elements
    sattisfy `1<=folds[j]<=ums[j]` where `ums` is short for `unit_multiplicity_super`.
